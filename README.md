# Multiparameter-Sensor-for-Water-Quality-Monitoring
Final year project by students Guilherme Panesi and Marlon Soares, aiming to develop a multiparameter sensor for water quality monitoring, taking into account the parameters established by Brazilian standards.

# INTRODUCTION
This project aims to develop a parametric sensor to monitor water quality in public and private swimming pools, respecting the criteria established by the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 10818, and to return the status to the user through a simple supervisory system, where it is possible to visually identify the situation in real time.

## MOTIVATION
Automating the monitoring of pH and chlorine levels in residential swimming pools is essential to ensure user safety, since maintaining these parameters within ideal ranges improves disinfection efficiency and prevents skin and eye irritation. Manual supervision, however, is time‑consuming, imprecise, and prone to human error, which can lead to issues such as algae growth, bacterial proliferation, and unnecessary consumption of chemical products. Studies show that low‑cost solutions based on devices like the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi provide an effective alternative for continuous monitoring, data collection, and real‑time visualization, enhancing reliability and usability. In addition, automation supports sustainability by reducing water and chemical waste, while also promoting digital inclusion by making smart technologies more accessible. This project is therefore justified by the need for an accurate, affordable, and efficient system for monitoring pH and chlorine in home pools, aligned with current IoT and automation trends.

## THEORICAL FOUNDATION
# Water quality indicators

Water quality parameters are essential to ensure that swimming pool water remains safe and suitable for use. They encompass physical, chemical, and microbiological components, which are regulated by standards such as NBR 10818/2016, which establishes the criteria for the treatment and maintenance of swimming pool water.
